## Installation

To install the plugin from this fork, follow these steps:

**Add a custom repository to your `composer.json`.** This instructs Composer to look for this fork in a GitHub repository.

> **Note:** This fork may get merged back into the main repo one dayâ€”so keep your fingers crossed! ðŸ¤ž

```json
{
   "repositories": [
       {
           "type": "vcs",
           "url": "https://github.com/curler7/Sylius-Backoffice-Plugin"
       }
   ]
}
```

Once you have added the custom repository, you can require the plugin using Composer
```bash
composer require abenmada/sylius-backoffice-plugin
```

### Update the bundles configuration:
Add the Backoffice Plugin to your `config/bundles.php` file by including the following line.
```php
<?php

return [
    //..
    Abenmada\BackofficePlugin\BackofficePlugin::class => ['all' => true],
]
```

### Create the configuration file:
Create the configuration file at `config/packages/abenmada_backoffice_plugin.yaml` to import the necessary services for the back office plugin.
```yaml
imports:
    - { resource: "@BackofficePlugin/Resources/config/services.yaml" }
```

### Update the entity:
To update the `Channel` entity in `src/Entity/Channel/Channel.php` for compatibility with the back office plugin and to extend its functionality with the images feature, follow the instructions below.
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Entity\Channel;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Abenmada\BackofficePlugin\Model\Channel\ChannelTrait as AbenmadaBackofficeChannelTrait;
use Sylius\Component\Core\Model\Channel as BaseChannel;
use Sylius\Component\Core\Model\ImagesAwareInterface;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="sylius_channel")
 */
class Channel extends BaseChannel implements ImagesAwareInterface
{
    use AbenmadaBackofficeChannelTrait;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->images = new ArrayCollection();
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
```

### Run the migration:
You have two migration versions available: [Version20220803192855 for MySQL](src/Migrations/Version20220803192855.php) and [Version20241101104421 for Postgres](src/Migrations/Version20241101104421.php). When you run the migration command, **Doctrine will automatically execute the appropriate version based on your database configuration**.
```bash
bin/console doctrine:migration:migrate
```

### Configure the parameter (optional):
If your channel entity class differs from the default, you need to set the `abenmada.backoffice.channel_class` parameter in your `config/services.yaml`, or you can set the `ABENMADA_BACKOFFICE_CHANNEL_CLASS` environment variable. This parameter specifies which class to use for the channel entity.
```yaml
parameters:
  abenmada.backoffice.channel_class: '%env(ABENMADA_BACKOFFICE_CHANNEL_CLASS)|App\Entity\Channel\Channel%'  # Default
```
> **Note:** If you are using the default namespace, this step can be skipped.

### Clear the cache:
After making changes to your configuration or service definitions, itâ€™s important to clear the cache to ensure that your application picks up the new settings. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal.
```bash
php bin/console cache:clear
```
